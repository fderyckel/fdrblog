Xgboost is part of the ensemble machine learning algorithms.  It can be used for both regression and classification.  There are few issues in using xgboost with time-series.  This article is taking a Xgboost post in python and also translating with the new R tidymodel framework.  

```{r}
#| message: false
#| warning: false

the_path <- here::here()
library(glue)
library(readr)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
```

```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
df0 <- read_csv(glue(the_path, "/raw_data/AEP_hourly.csv"))
```



```{python}
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

df0 = pd.read_csv("../../raw_data/AEP_hourly.csv", index_col = [0], parse_dates = [0])

plt.plot(df0)
```
